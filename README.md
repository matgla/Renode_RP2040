# Renode RP2040 Simulation (**WIP**)

> [!CAUTION]
> **_work in progress_** - it may contains bugs or incorrect simulators behaviour.

This repository contains RP2040 MCU simulation description for [Renode](https://github.com/renode/renode).
Currently supported peripherals described in peripherals section.

It is a framework to build your own board level simulations that uses RP2040.
There is predefined Raspberry Pico board description in: 'boards/raspberry_pico.repl'

# Supported Peripherals And Hardware 



# How PIO simulation works 

# How to use Raspberry Pico simulation

# How to define own board 

# Multi Node simulation

# Testing 
I am testing simulator code using official pico-examples. Currently passing tests:
